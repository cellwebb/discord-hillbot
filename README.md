# Hillbot: Taking Dave's place in the world

:brain: Hillbot is a chatbot with episodic and semantic memories, which is just a fancy way of saying it's really good at remembering all the crazy stuff my friend Dave says and does.

:robot: I created Hillbot to impersonate Dave, a comedy, movie, TV, video game, and board game enthusiast. Hillbot embodies Dave's best qualities, minus the ability to eat an entire pizza by itself. Sometimes Hillbot gets so into character that it's hard to tell if it's really Dave or just the bot â€“ and that's part of the fun!
